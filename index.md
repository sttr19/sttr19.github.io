## ABOUT ME

My name is Stanislau Troshka and I am an engineer. I have been working as a construction engineer for more than 10 years. But life is changing so 3 years ago I decided to change my professional focus and become a programming engineer. To make this transition happen, I have got a second high degree in Belarussian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. During my study, I got the basic skills of programming. Now I would like to practice and improve them and to develop as a specialist in this direction. I may describe myself as a responsible, focused on results person and a good team player.
